The intent of the Trustworthy Web Service Recommendation System is to help users make trustworthy and dependable online service selections in the midst of a confusing and expansive online environment
1. Reduce potential hazards: By creating a cutting-edge recommendation engine specifically designed to help users choose web services that closely match their unique needs.

2. Produce secured recommendations: the recommendation system uses a highly developed hybrid strategy that combines a self-attention mechanism with the advantages of the DeepFM model trained using Differential privacy.

3. Trust Score: The integration of the privacy-preserving module with a trust score mechanism further enhances the system's reliability and user trust![image](https://github.com/Arshad1709/Trustworthy-Recommendation-System/assets/90745111/4ad0ca5b-4b87-4be0-a19d-0fe743fc8437)
